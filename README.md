# This page needs a lot of picking yet but the start is done
# But the page passed the test, which was the point of that page

User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding <strong> id="header".</strong>

User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding<strong> id="header-img".</strong> A company logo would make a good image here.

User Story #3: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding<strong> id="nav-bar".</strong>

User Story #4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class<strong> nav-link.</strong>

User Story #5: When I click a<strong> .nav-link </strong>button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding <strong>section</strong> of the landing page.

User Story #6: I can watch an embedded product video with<strong> id="video".</storng>

User Story #7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding<strong> id="form".</strong>

User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with<strong> id="email"</strong> where I can enter an email address.

User Story #9: The #email input field should have <strong>placeholder</strong> text to let the user know what the field is for.

User Story #10: The #email input field uses<strong> HTML5 </strong>validation to confirm that the entered text is an <strong>email address.</strong>

User Story #11: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding<strong> id="submit".</strong>

User Story #12: When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

User Story #13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

User Story #14: My product landing page should have at least one media query.

User Story #15: My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
